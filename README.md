# C Project: C-Maze

## Introduction

I started learning the C programming language just two days ago, and I found myself struggling to come up with project ideas. So, I turned to AI for inspiration, and it suggested this project. After some research and experimentation, I decided to go ahead and build it.

This repository contains my work on this project, which serves as a great learning experience for both understanding C and applying the concepts I've recently discovered.

## ⚠️DISCLAIMER ⚠️
I have no clue if the maze's i provided are solvable, they were generated by AI because i was too bored to do it myself
